BBGLab cluster
==============

Our cluster is a shared space where we all work,
so it is important that we all share some common good practices.

Beside the good practices, remember always to be respectful
with your colleages:

- Do not take the whole cluster, even if the usage is low,
  specially when you are running long lasting jobs.
  Leave some room for the others.
